# MDC Web Roadmap
We release a new version of MDC Web every 2 weeks. We also limit our breaking changes to one release at the end of the month.
This roadmap contains tentative plans for MDC Web releases in the near future.

## Current Release

### 0.43.0 - January 2019

* MDC Button: Trailing icon support
* MDC Snackbar: Updates to match current guidelines

### 0.44.0 - February 2019

* MDC Text Field: Character counter support
* MDC Text Field: Independent label support

### 0.45.0 - March 2019

We are working on two major conversion projects during Q1 of 2019. We ideally want to complete them before March, but
they could realistically slip to the April release. Both conversions are aiming for minimal (ideally zero) breaking changes.

* TypeScript conversion ([#4225](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/issues/4225))
  * Ongoing throughout Q1 2019, but only released at the end once all packages are converted
* SCSS restructure to allow selectively including styles via mixins ([#4227](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/issues/4227))
  * Ongoing and gradually present in releases throughout Q1 2019
